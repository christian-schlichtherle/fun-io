/**
 * A socket is a reusable object for safe and simple automatic resource management.
 * It loans {@linkplain AutoCloseable auto-closeable resources} of type {@code <T>} to
 * {@linkplain XConsumer consumers} or {@linkplain XFunction functions} and ensures that the resource gets
 * automatically {@linkplain AutoCloseable#close() closed} when the consumer or function terminates.
 * It can also transform resources by applying a {@linkplain XFunction function} while ensuring that the resource gets
 * closed if the function fails with an exception.
 * <p>
 * The canonical way to <em>create</em> a socket is to use a lambda expression.
 * The following example creates a socket which provides write access for appending bytes to the file {@code test.txt}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * File file = new File("test.txt");
 * Socket<FileOutputStream> foss = () -> new FileOutputStream(file, true);
 * }</pre>
 * The canonical way to <em>use</em> a socket is to provide a lambda expression for a consumer or function to its
 * {@link #accept(XConsumer)} or {@link #apply(XFunction)} methods.
 * The following example uses the preceding socket to append {@code "Hello world!"} to the file {@code test.txt}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * foss.accept(fos -> new PrintStream(fos).println("Hello world!"));
 * }</pre>
 * A socket can also get <em>transformed</em> in a fail-safe way by calling its {@link #map(XFunction)} or
 * {@link #flatMap(XFunction)} methods.
 * The following example first filters the preceding file output stream socket into a print stream socket and then
 * appends {@code "Hello world!"} to the file {@code test.txt} again:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Socket<PrintStream> pss = foss.map(PrintStream::new);
 * pss.accept(ps -> ps.println("Hello world!"));
 * }</pre>
 * The preceding example can be simplified as follows:
 * <pre>{@code
 * foss.map(PrintStream::new).accept(ps -> ps.println("Hello world!"));
 * }</pre>
 * Because sockets are reusable {@code foss} and {@code pss} can be saved for subsequent use, including filtering:
 * On any use, a new {@code FileOutputStream} and a new {@code PrintStream} gets created.
 * The file output stream gets automatically closed in all examples, preventing the application from leaking file
 * descriptors.
 * Only the last two examples will close the print stream however.
 * With a print stream this is not a problem, but more complex decorators may buffer data or write some additional bytes
 * when closing, making it mandatory to close them, too.
 * Because of this, transforming a socket is generally preferable over decorating the given resource in a consumer or
 * function.
 * <p>
 * The following example safely filters a file output stream socket for writing {@code "Hello world!"} to the
 * compressed text file {@code "test.txt.gz"}.
 * It then safely filters a file input stream socket for reading the message back and printing it to standard output:
 * <pre>{@code
 * File file = new File("test.txt.gz");
 *
 * Socket<OutputStream> foss = () -> new FileOutputStream(file);
 * foss    .map(GZIPOutputStream::new)
 *         .map(PrintStream::new)
 *         .accept(ps -> ps.println("Hello world!"));
 *
 * Socket<InputStream> fiss = () -> new FileInputStream(file);
 * fiss    .map(GZIPInputStream::new)
 *         .map(InputStreamReader::new)
 *         .map(BufferedReader::new)
 *         .accept(br -> System.out.println(br.readLine()));
 * }</pre>
 * Should any filter fail, e.g. because the file system is full or the file's content is not in GZIP format,
 * then the sockets will properly close the previously created output or input stream and no resources will be leaked.
 *

 * @param <T> the type of the auto-closeable resource.
