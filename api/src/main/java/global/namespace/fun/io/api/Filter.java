/**
 * Decorates input and output stream {@linkplain Socket sockets} in order to transform the transmitted content.
 * <p>
 * With an encryption filter for example, the {@link #output} method would decorate the loaned output streams
 * with a new {@link javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream} in order to encrypt the data before writing it to the underlying
 * output stream.
 * Likewise, the {@link #input} method would decorate the loaned input streams with a new
 * {@link javax.crypto.CipherInputStream} in order to decrypt the data after reading it from the underlying input
 * stream.
 * <p>
 * As another example, with a compression filter the {@link #output} method would decorate the loaned output
 * streams with a new {@link java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream} in order to compress the data before writing it to the
 * underlying output stream.
 * Likewise, the {@link #input} method would decorate the loaned input streams with a new
 * {@link java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream} in order to decompress the data after reading it from the underlying input
 * stream.
 * <p>
 * The benefit of this interface is that you can easily compose it in order to create rich filters without needing to
 * know anything about their implementation.
 * <p>
 * For example, depending on the previous examples, the following test code would assert the round-trip processing of
 * the string {@code "Hello world!"} using the composition of some compression and encryption filters on
 * some store:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Filter compression = ...;
 * Filter encryption = ...;
 * Store store = ...;
 * Store compressedAndEncryptedStore = store.map(compression.compose(encryption));
 * // ... which is the same as:
 * // Store compressedAndEncryptedStore = store.map(encryption).map(compression);
 * Socket<OutputStream> compressedAndEncryptedData = store.output();
 * Socket<InputStream> decryptedAndDecompressedData = store.input();
 * compressedAndEncryptedData.map(PrintWriter::new).accept(writer -> writer.println("Hello world!"));
 * decryptedAndDecompressedData.map(InputStreamReader::new).map(BufferedReader::new).accept(reader ->
 *     assertTrue("Hello world!".equals(reader.readLine())));
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * For the mathematically inclined, this class forms a
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group</a> under its {@link #compose(Filter)}
 * operator and its {@link #IDENTITY} instance.
